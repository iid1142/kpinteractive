## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of

comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event.
